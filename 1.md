Hello guys, I hope this one will be useful.

1. Always use `fclose(file)` after you've done reading a file. Otherwise you might spend a lot of time trying to find a bug.
2. You can't use `fgets()` to read `keyFile.254`, because there is a `'\0'` in the middle of it. You need to use a function which will take any character, whatever it might be. Does such function exist?
3. Try to break everything into small functions. If your function starts expanding, then you have to rewrite it by using more functions. For example, you have to print newline after every message, you might forget putting one. ```C++
printf("WELCOME to encryption programm\n");
``` This is a no-go! It may seem easy with one message, but if you may have many messages, you may get easily confused. Instead try this:```C++
void f(char *s){
  printf("%s", s);
  putchar('\n');
}

int main(){
  f("With this, you");
  f("don't have to worry");
  f("about newlines)");
  return 0;
}
```
4. Another problem is that you may have a newline in a filename, which will hinder the process of opening the file. You have to remove the trailing newline. If you noticed, you can write another function which does exactly that:```C++
void g(char s[]){
  int n = strlen(s);
  if(s[n - 1] == '\n') s[n - 1] = '\0'; // end the string
}
``` If you are worried that you can't use `strlen()`, you may write your own. It's not that hard.
6. Another problem some might experience, is that if their text is the length of `n`, their encrypted file may have `n + 1` characters. This may be because you accidentally encrypt `EOF` character which has a value of `255` in decimal of `11111111` in binary.
```
That's about it. And another thing, nobody should know about this file, especially `M***`.
